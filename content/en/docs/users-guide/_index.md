categories: [Documentation]

The CardboardCompanion has three buckets of things it can do. Slash Commands, cron jobs,
and Read/respond to messges.

## [Slash Commands](/docs/users-guide/commands)

There are three slash commands implemented in CardboardCompanion so far.

- /format - Run an ad-hoc format poll
- /wheel - Spin the wheel of fun
- /ping - A basic health check

Find out more in the relavent [documentation](/docs/users-guide/commands)

## [Cron Jobs](/docs/users-guide/cron-jobs)

There is currently only one cron-job. It can be scheduled to run the poll interaction at
a specific schedule.

## Message Interaction

If you say `ping`, they say `Pong!`. It's that simple.
